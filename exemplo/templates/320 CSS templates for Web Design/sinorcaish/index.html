<h1>The Sinorcaish Stylesheet v1.2</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>Sinorcaish stylesheet</strong>!  This stylesheet
gives your web site an attractive, clean-look interface while maintaining
a separation of style and content to the greatest possible extent.  This
allows you to concentrate on the structure and content of your documents,
safe in the knowledge that the Sinorcaish stylesheet will do a great job
of presenting them to the rest of the world.</p>


<h2>Features and Benefits</h2>


<div class="floatbox">
  <hr />
  <p class="title">Images for Sinorcaish</p>

  <p>The version of Sinorcaish available from the <a
    href="http://www.oswd.org/">Open Source Web Design group</a> does
    <em>not</em> contain any graphical images.</p>

  <p>If you would like some appropriate sample images that you can use in
    your own documents, you should download the version available from the
    <a href="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/">official
    Sinorcaish web site</a>.</p>

  <hr />
</div>


<p>The Sinorcaish stylesheet was designed with <em>you</em>, the web site
document writer, in mind:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>The Sinorcaish distribution comes with an extensive <a
    href="sample.html">sample document</a> that illustrates many of the
    features of this stylesheet.  This eliminates the guess-work of asking
    &ldquo;how do I do that?&rdquo; in creating top-quality
    documents.</p></li>

  <li><p>A simple <a href="template.html">template</a> makes writing your
    own documents relatively painless.</p></li>

  <li><p>As much as possible, style has been separated from content; for
    example, not a single table is used for visual formatting.  In
    addition, the amount of &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; markup is kept to a
    minimum.</p></li>

  <li><p>Full step-by-step instructions are included to make it easy for
    you to <a href="logo.html">create your own logo image</a> similar to
    the one used by Sinorcaish.</p></li>

  <li><p>Sinorcaish conforms to the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1">XHTML 1.0 Strict</a> and <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21"><acronym
    title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> 2.1</a> Web standards.
    This, along with an emphasis on structure and content, allows you to
    meet the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10">Web Content
    Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a> at Level Double-A (or even Triple-A)
    with ease.</p></li>

  <li><p>Sinorcaish has been tested under the latest versions of
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>,
    <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>,
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>,
    <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>,
    <a href="http://lynx.isc.org/">Lynx</a> and
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Internet Explorer</a>.
    You can rest assured that your documents will look their best in
    <em>any</em> modern browser.</p></li>

</ul>


<h2>Inspiration and Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>The design of Sinorcaish was influenced by <a
href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/1165/">Sinorca</a>,
implemented by <a href="http://www.oswd.org/user/profile/id/3013/">Haran
Sivakumaran</a>.  Sinorca, in turn, was based on the look-and-feel of the
<a href="http://www.acronis.com/">Acronis</a> company web site as it
existed at the time.</p>

<p>Although the Sinorca stylesheet is quite good, it is rather limited: it
does not allow <span class="tooltip"
title="An example of a floating text box on this page is &ldquo;Images for Sinorcaish&rdquo;.">floating
text boxes</span>, does not really cater for computer-oriented
documentation (which requires appropriate styling for elements like <code
class="markup">&lt;code&gt;</code>, <code
class="markup">&lt;kbd&gt;</code> and <code
class="markup">&lt;pre&gt;</code>), and completely ignores (data) tables
and many other XHTML elements.  These limitations, along with the desire
to update parts of the visual interface, led to Sinorcaish: a complete
redesign and reimplementation of the Acronis look-and-feel.</p>

<p>The Sinorcaish stylesheet could not have been designed without Eric
Meyer&rsquo;s excellent book, <cite><a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/css2/">Cascading Style Sheets: The
Definitive Guide (Second Edition)</a></cite>, published by O&rsquo;Reilly
(ISBN 0-596-00525-3).  This book is simply one of the best in its
class!</p>


<h2>Some Testimonials</h2>

<p>Sinorcaish is being used successfully on web sites all over the world,
as illustrated by just some of the responses received by e-mail:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>&ldquo;Just saw your Sinorcaish template on OSWD and I must say
    that it&rsquo;s brilliant.  You&rsquo;ve obviously put a lot of work

    tutorial is an excellent inclusion.&rdquo;

    html-sampler.  Wow!  You made it easy to get my head around CSS, which
