The Sinorcaish stylesheet project gives any web site an attractive, clean-
look interface while maintaining a  separation of style and content to the
greatest possible  extent.  This allows  the web author to  concentrate on
the structure  and content of his  or her documents, rather  than on their
presentation.

The following history is presented in reverse chronological order.  If you
would like to  see a list of detailed changes to  this project, you should
consult the Subversion repository  for "sinorcaish"  on  The ZAP Group web
server at http://www.zap.org.au/services/svn/.


Version 1.2 (10th January, 2006)
--------------------------------

Very  minor  update  to  conform  to  the Open  Source  Web  Design  group
submission requirements: replaced image  references to the W3C buttons and
the  Sinorcaish logo  with text  equivalents in  the OSWD  version  of the
project.


Version 1.1 (21st December, 2005)
---------------------------------

Relatively minor updates  to the  Sinorcaish stylesheet:  added "program",
"window", "menu", "gui" and "key" styles  for parts of  graphical computer
programs,  changed the  display fonts to include  Bitstream Vera Sans  and
Lucida Sans in addition to Verdana,  tweaked the printing fonts to include
Bitstream Vera Serif, Lucida Bright and Georgia  in addition to  Times New
Roman, and adjusted the positioning and size of fixed-width text.

Added some testimonials  to "index.html".  Added a number of optimised PNG
button-style images  from the W3C web site,  http://www.w3.org/.  Included
extensive instructions in "logo.html", with screenshots,  on how to create
the logo image using the GIMP; this was the most frequently-asked question
about Sinorcaish!


Version 1.0 (1st December, 2004)
--------------------------------

Needed an attractive, clean-look web  site design for a particular project
in November,  2004.  Looked at  a number of  styles available on  the Open
Source Web Design web  site (http://www.oswd.org/) and elsewhere.  Sinorca
(http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/1165/) by  Haran Sivakumaran seemed
to  be a good  starting point.   Sinorca, in  its turn,  was based  on the
Acronis company web site (http://www.acronis.com/).

Although the Sinorca stylesheet was  quite good, it seemed rather limited:
it did not  allow floating text boxes, did not  really cater for computer-
oriented  documentation (which requires  appropriate styling  for elements
like <code>,  <kbd> and <pre>),  and completely ignored (data)  tables and
many other XHTML elements.

These limitations,  along with  the desire to  update parts of  the visual
interface, led to Sinorcaish:  a complete redesign and reimplementation of
the Acronis look-and-feel.  Wrote  a comprehensive "How to Use Sinorcaish"
sample  document, created  template files  and images,  and  submitted the
result to the Open Source Web Design group in December, 2004.
