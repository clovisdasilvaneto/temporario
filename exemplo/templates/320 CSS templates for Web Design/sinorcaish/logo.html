<h1>Creating Your Own Logo Images for Sinorcaish</h1>


<p>This document shows you, step by step, how to create your own logo
image for the Sinorcaish stylesheet using the <a
href="http://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program</a>.  Although
the instructions in this document were developed under the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> operating system
running the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">K Desktop Environment</a>, there
should not be too much difference when running under Microsoft Windows,
Apple Mac OS&nbsp;X or a BSD-based operating system.</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you start, you need to make sure you have the following
installed on your system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation
    Program</a> (also known as the GIMP), version 2.2 or later, and</li>
  <li>The <strong>Verdana Bold</strong> font, formerly part of the
    Microsoft Core Web TrueType fonts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Verdana Bold font is installed as a core component of Microsoft
Windows and Apple Mac OS&nbsp;X.  If you do not have this font, you may
use the <strong>Bitstream Vera Sans Bold</strong> font as a reasonable
substitute.  The Bitstream Vera font family was developed by Bitstream
Inc. and is freely available from the <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">GNOME Desktop Environment Fonts web
site</a>.  The Bitstream Vera fonts should already be installed on most
Linux and BSD-based distributions.</p>

<p>This document assumes that you are familiar with using graphical
applications, although you may not be an expert when it comes to using the
GIMP.  The following conventions are used in this document:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The notation <span class="menu">File&nbsp;&raquo; New</span>
    means that you need to select <span class="menu">File</span> from the
    appropriate window menu, then select the <span class="menu">New</span>
    menu item.</p></li>

  <li><p><dfn>Left-clicking</dfn> and <dfn>right-clicking</dfn> refer to
    clicking the left or right mouse button.  This assumes, of course,
    that you haven&rsquo;t swapped the mouse buttons around; if so, you
    will need to mentally adjust every occurrence of these
    phrases.</p></li>

  <li><p>When you are asked to press an alphabetic key, such as <span
    class="key">M</span>, do <em>not</em> use the <span
    class="key">Shift</span> key: if <span class="key">Shift</span> is
    needed, it will be shown by something like <span
    class="key">Shift+M</span>.</p></li>

  <li><p><dfn>Selecting a window</dfn> means using the mouse or <span
    class="key">Alt+Tab</span> (or equivalent) to bring that window to the
    front and/or make sure the window is receiving keyboard input.  In
    X&nbsp;Window parlance (as used on Linux and BSD-based systems), this
    is known as making sure the window has <dfn>input
    focus</dfn>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="step1">Step 1: Start Running the GIMP</h3>

<p>Start the GNU Image Manipulation Program in the usual way.  In general,
the exact sequence of steps you need to perform to execute the GIMP
depends very much on the system you are running.  Try looking around your
<span class="menu">Start</span> menu (if applicable), or type
<kbd>gimp</kbd> on the command line.</p>

<p>If this is your first time starting the GIMP, you will be walked
through the <span class="window">GIMP User Installation</span> wizard.  In
most cases, clicking <span class="gui">Continue</span> throughout the
wizard will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The GIMP is a very powerful software package for manipulating images.
It comes with extensive documentation that you are encouraged to read.
And it&rsquo;s completely free!</p>


<h3 id="step2">Step 2: Set the Foreground Colour</h3>

<p>Once the GIMP has started, you need to set the foreground colour to
cyan.  To do this, double-click on the current foreground colour (which is
typically black).  You can find the current foreground colour in the main
toolbox window (whose window title should be &ldquo;The GIMP&rdquo;) under
the various tool icon buttons.  When the <span class="window">Change
Foreground Color</span> dialog box appears, remove anything that appears
in the <span class="gui">HTML Notation</span> text edit box, then enter
<kbd>00FFFF</kbd> in that box and click <span class="gui">OK</span>.</p>


<h3 id="step3">Step 3: Create a New Image</h3>

<p>Create a new image by selecting <span class="menu">File&nbsp;&raquo;
New</span> (you can also press <span class="key">Ctrl+N</span>).  The
<span class="window">Create a New Image</span> dialog box will appear.
Click on the <span class="gui">Advanced Options</span> line, then make
sure the settings in the dialog box match the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Width: 400 pixels</strong>.  This is not a critical value
    (at this stage); it depends on the text you plan to include as part of
    your logo.  Any value from about 250 to 500 pixels will do, although
    you should plan your logo to be no more than 400 pixels wide, if at
    all possible; this may mean you need to use a smaller font for your
    logo in <a href="#step6">step&nbsp;6</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>Height: 60 pixels</strong>.  Again, this value depends on
    your logo text.  Ideally, your logo should consist of a
    <em>single</em> line of text with either one or two words.</li>

  <li><strong>Colorspace: RGB color</strong>.</li>

  <li><strong>Fill with: Foreground color</strong>.  This is an easy
    setting to overlook!</li>

  <li><strong>Comment:</strong> You should set this to something like
    &ldquo;Copyright &copy;&nbsp;2006, <var>copyright owner</var>&rdquo;,
    where the copyright owner is either you (enter your full name, in this
    case), or your company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Entering the copyright symbol &ldquo;&copy;&rdquo; in the GIMP can be
tricky.  Under Windows, hold down the left <span class="key">Alt</span>
key.  While holding down this key, type <span class="key">0169</span>
<em>using the numeric keypad</em>.  Finally, release the <span
class="key">Alt</span> key: the copyright symbol should appear.  Under
Linux, the easiest way to obtain this character is to generate it using
another application, then use the clipboard to paste it into the GIMP.
For example, under KDE, run the <span class="program">kcharselect</span>
Character Selection application.  When this program appears, enter
<kbd>00A9</kbd> into the <span class="gui">UTF code</span> field, press
the <span class="key">Enter</span> key, then click on the <span
class="gui">To Clipboard</span> button.  Finally, press <span
class="key">Ctrl+V</span> in the <span class="gui">Comment</span> text box
in the GIMP.  You can also use the OpenOffice Writer to do the same thing.
If worst comes to worst, you can always simply use the three ASCII
characters &ldquo;<code>(C)</code>&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Once the settings in the dialog box match the above list, click <span
class="gui">OK</span>.  A new window should open containing the image, as
shown in Figure&nbsp;1; this window will be called the <dfn>image
window</dfn> for the rest of this document:</p>

<blockquote>

    alt="[Screenshot of the GIMP new image window]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;1:</strong> Screenshot of the new image window in
    the GIMP.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step4">Step 4: Save That Image!</h3>

<p>Now that you have created a brand new image, the first thing you should
do is save it.  To do this, select the image window and press <span
class="key">Ctrl+S</span> (or select <span class="menu">File&nbsp;&raquo;
Save</span> from the image window&rsquo;s menu).  A <span
class="window">Save Image</span> dialog box will appear, asking for the
name you wish to give the image.  Type in an appropriate name with <span
class="fn">.xcf</span> as the extension; <span
class="fn">sinorcaish.xcf</span> will be used in this document.  Make sure
the <span class="gui">Save in folder</span> location is appropriate before
clicking <span class="gui">Save</span>.</p>

<p>From now on, you should press <span class="key">Ctrl+S</span> at the
end of each step &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to lose all of your work
due to a power failure, for example!</p>


<h3 id="step5">Step 5: Revert to Default Colours</h3>

<p>Make sure the image window is selected, then press <span
class="key">D</span> (or select <span class="menu">Tools&nbsp;&raquo;
Default Colors</span>).  The current foreground colour (as shown in the
main toolbox window) should revert to black; the current background colour
should remain white.</p>


<h3 id="step6">Step 6: Enter the Full Logo Text</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to enter the logo text!  To do this, press <span
class="key">T</span> (or select <span class="menu">Tools&nbsp;&raquo;
Text</span>).  The tool options in the main toolbox window should show
<span class="gui">Text</span> as the title.  Make sure the settings in
that window match the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Font: Verdana Bold</strong>.  If you do not have this font,
    you can select <strong>Bitstream Vera Sans Bold</strong> instead.  You
    should <em>not</em> be tempted to use another font, particularly
    Arial, as the results will not match the &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo;
    of the Sinorcaish stylesheet.</li>
  <li><strong>Size: 50&nbsp;px</strong>.  You may need to tweak this
    setting if your logo turns out too large; you can do so in <a
    href="#step7">step&nbsp;7</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Hinting: selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Force auto-hinter: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Antialiasing: selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Color: Black</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Justify: Left justified</strong> (the first button).</li>
  <li><strong>Indent: 0.0</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Line spacing: 0.0</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can play around with some of these settings (particularly hinting
and auto-hinting) in <a href="#step7">step&nbsp;7</a>; in general,
however, leaving these settings as suggested here gives a more pleasing
result.</p>

<p>Once these settings have been entered, select the image window, then
click the left mouse at a point close to the top left-hand corner.  Notice
that the pixel position of the mouse is given in the bottom left-hand
corner of the window; you should left-click when this shows
<strong>10,&nbsp;0</strong>.</p>

<p>Once you left-click, the <span class="window">GIMP Text Editor</span>
dialog box should appear.  Enter the full text of your logo;
&ldquo;Sinorcaish&rdquo; will be used in this document.  Notice how the
final result appears in the image window as you type.  Click <span
class="gui">Close</span> when finished.  This provides the <dfn>guide
text</dfn>; you should end up with a window that looks like
Figure&nbsp;2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen2.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the image window with logo text]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;2:</strong> Screenshot of the image window with
    the logo text &ldquo;Sinorcaish&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step7">Step 7: Tweak the Logo Text (Optional)</h3>

<p>If the logo text is too long to fit into the image size, you may need
to do one of two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start again by jumping to <a href="#step2">step&nbsp;2</a>, this
    time selecting a new image that is wider than the last one; or</li>
  <li>Resize the current logo text.</li>
</ol>

<p>To resize the current logo text, first left-click on any part of the
text logo.  Next, simply alter the value of <span class="gui">Size</span>
in the text tool options.  The logo text will be resized in &ldquo;real
time&rdquo;.  You may also modify the hinting and auto-hinting parameters
in a similar fashion to see which settings look better for you.</p>

<p>If you change the size of the logo text, you may need to reposition it.
To do this, press <span class="key">M</span> (or select <span
class="menu">Tools&nbsp;&raquo; Transform Tools&nbsp;&raquo; Move</span>).
Then, hold down the left <span class="key">Shift</span> key and use the
left mouse button to drag the logo to the desired position.  You can even
zoom in on the image for a closer look to make this easier: press the
<span class="key">+</span> key (actually <span
class="key">Shift</span>+<span class="key">=</span>) a few times, or use
the <span class="menu">View&nbsp;&raquo; Zoom</span> menu.</p>


<h3 id="step8">Step 8: Rename and Expand the Text Layer</h3>

<p>Select the <span class="window">Layers</span> dialog box by pressing
<span class="key">Ctrl+L</span> (or by selecting <span
class="menu">Dialogs&nbsp;&raquo; Layers</span>).  Right-click on the
layer name corresponding to the logo text (in this case, Sinorcaish).
Select <span class="menu">Edit Layer Attributes&hellip;</span> from the
pop-up menu that appears; this should cause the <span class="window">Layer
Attributes</span> dialog box to appear.</p>

<p>In the <span class="window">Layer Attributes</span> dialog box, change
the layer name to <strong>Guide Text</strong>.  Make sure <span
class="gui">Set Name from Text</span> is <em>not</em> selected before
clicking <span class="gui">OK</span>.</p>

<p>Next, right-click on this newly-named layer and select <span
class="menu">Layer to Image Size</span>.  This should expand the dashed
outline of the layer to the whole image, as shown in Figure&nbsp;3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen3.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the renamed image layer]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;3:</strong> Screenshot of the image window with
    the renamed layer name.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step9">Step 9: The White Part of the Logo</h3>

<p>Select white as the current foreground colour.  There are at least two
ways of doing this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Double-click on the foreground colour in the toolbar, then set the
    <span class="gui">HTML Notation</span> text edit box to
    <kbd>FFFFFF</kbd>; or</li>
  <li>Make sure the default colours are selected (by pressing <span
    class="key">D</span>, as in <a href="#step5">step&nbsp;5</a>), then
    press <span class="key">X</span> to swap current foreground and
    background colours.  Learning the keyboard shortcuts in the GIMP makes
    your job <em>much</em> faster!</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, select the text tool once again by pressing <span
class="key">T</span> (or by selecting <span
class="menu">Tools&nbsp;&raquo; Text</span>).  The tool options should
still be the same as in <a href="#step6">step&nbsp;6</a> (or <a
href="#step7">step&nbsp;7</a> if you tweaked the size of the logo text).
Left-click at the same spot as you started the previous text string, that
is, at pixel location <strong>10,&nbsp;0</strong>.  The <span
class="window">GIMP Text Editor</span> dialog box should reappear.  Enter
the first part of your logo text, the part that is to be white (in this
case, &ldquo;Sinorca&rdquo;), then click <span
class="gui">Close</span>.</p>

<p>Depending on how accurately you clicked the left mouse button and/or
whether you moved the guide text around in <a
href="#step7">step&nbsp;7</a>, you may need to move the new text layer
around until you get a perfect overlap (although you <em>may</em> still
see faint traces of black around the edges).  To do this, press <span
class="key">M</span>, then make sure that the <span class="gui">Transform
layer</span> icon (the first one following the <span
class="gui">Affect:</span> label) is selected in the <span
class="gui">Move</span> tool options.  Finally, move the white text around
by holding down the left <span class="key">Shift</span> key while dragging
the left mouse button.</p>

<p>Once you have achieved a perfect overlap, move to the <span
class="window">Layers</span> dialog box by pressing <span
class="key">Ctrl+L</span>, right-click on the new layer name and select
<span class="menu">Edit Layer Attributes&hellip;</span>.  Change the layer
name to <strong>White Text</strong>, make sure <span class="gui">Set Name
from Text</span> is <em>not</em> selected and click <span
class="gui">OK</span>.  Finally, right-click on the (new) layer name and
select <span class="menu">Layer to Image Size</span>.  You should end up
with a window similar to Figure&nbsp;4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen4.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the white logo text]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;4:</strong> Screenshot of the image window with
    the white logo text &ldquo;Sinorca&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step10">Step 10: The Orange Part of the Logo</h3>

<p>Now that you have entered the white part of the logo, you need to do
the same for the orange part.  First, set the current foreground colour to
<kbd>FF9800</kbd> (see the instructions in <a
href="#step2">step&nbsp;2</a> if you are not sure how to do this).</p>

<p>Next, select the image window and choose the text tool again by
pressing <span class="key">T</span>.  Left-click near the location of the
second part of the logo text &mdash; in the case of
&ldquo;Sinorcaish&rdquo;, for example, the start of the &ldquo;ish&rdquo;
is around pixel location <strong>220,&nbsp;0</strong>.  Enter the part of
the logo text that is meant to be orange into the <span
class="window">GIMP Text Editor</span> dialog box, then move the layer
around (by selecting the move tool with the <span class="key">M</span>
key) until you achieve a perfect overlap.</p>

<p>Once the new text layer aligns perfectly with the guide text, change
the layer name to <strong>Orange Text</strong> and expand the layer to the
image size using <span class="menu">Layer to Image Size</span> &mdash; the
details are contained in the <a href="#step9">previous step</a>.  Your
image window should now look something like Figure&nbsp;5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen5.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the orange logo text]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;5:</strong> Screenshot of the image window with
    the orange logo text &ldquo;ish&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step11">Step 11: Create the Gradient Layer</h3>

<p>Now for the fun part: creating the gradient transition from a darker
blue to a lighter blue under the current text.  Make sure the <span
class="window">Layers</span> dialog box window is selected by pressing
<span class="key">Ctrl+L</span>.  Right-click on the <span
class="key">Guide Text</span> layer name in this dialog box window, then
select <span class="menu">New Layer&hellip;</span> from the pop-up menu.
A <span class="window">New Layer</span> dialog box should appear.</p>

<p>Once the <span class="window">New Layer</span> dialog box appears,
change the layer name to <strong>Gradient</strong>.  Make sure the <span
class="gui">Layer Fill Type</span> is set to <span
class="gui">Transparency</span> before clicking <span
class="gui">OK</span>.</p>

<p>Now that a new layer has been created to hold the gradient, set the
current foreground colour to <kbd>3365CB</kbd> and the current background
colour to <kbd>8CA8E6</kbd>.  You can set the background colour in the
same way as you set the foreground colour (see <a
href="#step2">step&nbsp;2</a> for the details); the only difference is
that you double-click on the background colour instead of the foreground
colour.</p>

<p>Make sure the image window is selected, then press <span
class="key">L</span> (or select <span class="menu">Tools&nbsp;&raquo;
Paint Tools&nbsp;&raquo; Blend</span>) to select the Gradient Fill tool
(also known as the Blend tool).  Make sure the settings in the main
toolbox window match the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Opacity: 100.0</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Mode: Normal</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Gradient: FG to BG (RGB)</strong>.  You may need to click on
    the drop-down list to see the name of the gradient.</li>
  <li><strong>Reverse: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Offset: 0.0</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Shape: Linear</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat: None</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Dithering: selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptive Supersampling: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the Gradient Fill settings are correct, hold down the <span
class="key">Ctrl</span> key and drag the left mouse button in a horizontal
direction from left to right in the image window.  Releasing the left
mouse button (and the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key) will draw the
gradient.</p>

<p>The starting and ending pixel coordinates of the mouse drag depend very
much on your logo text.  The suggested formula is to take the starting
point of the orange text (which you worked out roughly in <a
href="#step10">step&nbsp;10</a>) and subtract&nbsp;/ add 60 pixels or so
to get the start and end positions respectively.  For example, the
&ldquo;ish&rdquo; in &ldquo;Sinorcaish&rdquo; begins at about pixel
position 220 (the vertical coordinate is not important here).  Thus, 220
&plusmn;&nbsp;60 pixels gives a starting position of 160 and an ending
position of 280.</p>

<p>In practice, you may need to experiment with the gradient fill tool
before you are satisfied with the result.  Always remember that pressing
<span class="key">Ctrl+Z</span> (or selecting <span
class="menu">Edit&nbsp;&raquo; Undo</span>) undoes any mistakes you might
make, allowing you to try again!  You should end up with something like
Figure&nbsp;6:</p>

<h3 id="step12">Step 12: Shadow for the White Text</h3>

<p>The GIMP makes it very easy to add a shadow (also called a <dfn>drop
shadow</dfn>) behind text letters.  To add such a shadow, select the
<strong>White Text</strong> layer by left-clicking on the layer name in
the <span class="window">Layers</span> dialog box.  Next, select <span
class="menu">Script-Fu&nbsp;&raquo; Shadow&nbsp;&raquo; Drop-Shadow</span>
from the image window menu bar.  A <span class="window">Script-Fu:
Drop-Shadow</span> dialog box will appear.  Make sure the settings in this
dialog box match the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Offset X: 3</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Offset Y: 3</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Blur Radius: 6</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Color: 003399</strong>.  You will need to click on the
    colour (typically black) to pop up a <span class="window">Script-Fu
    Color Selection</span> dialog box to do this.</li>
  <li><strong>Opacity: 95</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow resizing: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clicking on the <span class="gui">OK</span> button will create a dark
blue shadow just to the right and below each of the white letters.  You
can experiment with almost all of the above settings (apart from <span
class="gui">Allow resizing</span>) until you are satisfied with the
result: simply press <span class="key">Ctrl+Z</span> to undo the shadow
and try again!</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied with the way the shadow looks, move to the <span
class="window">Layers</span> dialog box by pressing <span
class="key">Ctrl+L</span>.  Rename the newly-created
<strong>Drop-Shadow</strong> layer to <strong>White Text Shadow</strong>
and expand the layer boundary to the image size using the <span
class="menu">Layer to Image Size</span> pop-up menu item (the exact
sequence of steps has already been covered in <a
href="#step8">step&nbsp;8</a>).  You should end up with a window that
looks something like Figure&nbsp;7:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen7.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the white text shadow]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;7:</strong> Screenshot of the image window with
    the white text shadow.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step13">Step 13: Shadow for the Orange Text</h3>

<p>Adding a shadow to the orange text is done in exactly the same way as
<a href="#step12">step&nbsp;12</a>; the only difference is that the
<strong>Orange Text</strong> layer needs to be selected instead of the
<strong>White Text</strong> layer.  You should also use the same settings
for the <span class="window">Script-Fu: Drop-Shadow</span> dialog box.
Figure&nbsp;8 should be the result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen8.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the orange text shadow]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;8:</strong> Screenshot of the image window with
    the orange text shadow.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step14">Step 14: Crop the Image</h3>

<p>You are now on the home stretch!  When you created the new image in <a
href="#step3">step&nbsp;3</a>, you almost certainly created one that was
too large.  This unneeded space to the right of the orange text should be
trimmed (cropped), as it only represents a logo image that is larger than
it needs to be.  Such an image will take more space on the hard drive and
will take longer to download, sometimes significantly so.</p>

<p>To crop the image, press <span class="key">Shift+C</span> (or select
<span class="menu">Tools&nbsp;&raquo; Transform Tools&nbsp;&raquo;
Crop&nbsp;&amp; Resize</span>).  Click and drag the left mouse button from
coordinate <strong>0,&nbsp;0</strong> in the top left-hand corner to the
bottom right-hand side of the image.  A <span
class="window">Crop&nbsp;&amp; Resize</span> dialog box will pop up;
ignore it while you are dragging the mouse button.  Once you let go,
select the dialog box window and adjust the settings to match the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Origin X: 0</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Origin Y: 0</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Width:</strong> an appropriately rounded figure.  For
    example, the Sinorcaish logo was cropped from a width of 400 pixels to
    325, even though a figure of 308 or so might have sufficed.</li>
  <li><strong>Height:</strong> the height of your image as selected in <a
    href="#step3">step&nbsp;3</a>, typically <strong>60</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Aspect ratio:</strong> ignore this value.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will notice that the crop highlight automatically adjusts itself as
you alter these values.  Once you are satisfied with the new width, press
the <span class="gui">Crop</span> button.  The image will be resized,
leaving you with something like Figure&nbsp;9:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen9.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the cropped image]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;9:</strong> Screenshot of the image window cropped
    to the required final size.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step15">Step 15: Duplicate the Image</h3>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already done so, save the current image by
pressing <span class="key">Ctrl+S</span>.  This image represents the final
&ldquo;high-quality&rdquo; version of your logo; further manipulations
will be done to a <em>copy</em> of this image.</p>

<p>To make a copy of the image, select the image window and press <span
class="key">Ctrl+D</span> (or select <span class="menu">Image&nbsp;&raquo;
Duplicate</span>).  A new image window with &ldquo;Untitled&rdquo; in its
title will appear; this window will be called the <dfn>new image
window</dfn>, appropriately enough, for the rest of this document.</p>


<h3 id="step16">Step 16: Make a Single Layer</h3>

<p>Select <span class="menu">Image&nbsp;&raquo; Flatten Image</span> from
the new image window&rsquo;s menu.  This causes all seven layers to
collapse into a single layer.</p>


<h3 id="step17">Step 17: Convert to Indexed Format</h3>

<p>Most images do not need the full range of colours offered by the RGB
colour-space in which the image was created: converting it to an
<dfn>indexed format</dfn> can save over 50% of disk space for the image,
making it load a least twice as fast.  In the case of the Sinorcaish logo,
for example, the resulting image shrunk from 14,429 bytes to 6,576 bytes:
a reduction of over 54%!</p>

<p>Select <span class="menu">Image&nbsp;&raquo; Mode&nbsp;&raquo;
Indexed&hellip;</span> from the new image window&rsquo;s menu.  An <span
class="window">Index Color Conversion</span> dialog box will appear.  Make
sure the settings in this dialog box match the following before clicking
<span class="gui">OK</span>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Colormap: Generate optimum palette</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Maximum number of colors: 256</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Color dithering: None</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable dithering of transparency: <em>not</em>
    selected</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should end up with something like Figure&nbsp;10; notice the new
image window now has &ldquo;indexed&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;RGB&rdquo; in
its title:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen10.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the indexed image]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;10:</strong> Screenshot of the image window
    converted to an indexed format.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step18">Step 18: (Almost) the Final Save</h3>

<p>Make sure the new image window is selected and press <span
class="key">Ctrl+S</span> (or select <span class="menu">File&nbsp;&raquo;
Save</span>).  A <span class="window">Save Image</span> dialog box will
appear.  Enter the name of the logo image filename with <span
class="fn">.png</span> as the extension; <span
class="fn">sinorcaish.png</span> will be used in this document.  Once
again, make sure the <span class="gui">Save in folder</span> location is
appropriate before clicking <span class="gui">Save</span>.  This will, in
turn, cause a <span class="window">Save as PNG</span> dialog box to
appear.  Make sure the settings in that dialog box agree with the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Interlacing (Adam7): <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Save background color: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Save gamma: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Save layer offset: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Save resolution: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Save creation time: <em>not</em> selected</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Save comment: selected</strong>.  Please note, however, that
    even though this option should be selected, the <span
    class="window">Save as PNG</span> dialog box might <em>not</em> save
    the comment; this bug may have been fixed in later versions of the
    GIMP.</li>
  <li><strong>Compression level: 9</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clicking <span class="gui">OK</span> will save the image in Portable
Network Graphics format, the format recommended by the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> for images.  You
should get a window similar to Figure&nbsp;11:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen11.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the saved indexed image]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;11:</strong> Screenshot of the final image
    window (excluding Step&nbsp;19).</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="step19">Step 19: For the Perfectionist</h3>

<p>(If you are not a perfectionist, you may safely skip this rather
advanced step: jump directly to <a href="#step20">step&nbsp;20</a> without
further ado.  If you don&rsquo;t mind spending a little extra time and
effort to produce the best possible logo, read on&hellip;)</p>

<p>The conversion to indexed format that the GIMP uses is good, but not
perfect.  In particular, the colours present in the final image may not be
the ones selected during the design: there is no way to tag certain
colours as being important.  This can be especially noticeable with the
light blue colour on the right-hand side of the image and the white used
in the logo text.  The solution is to manually fix the colour palette used
by the image.</p>

<p>Make sure the new image window is selected and press <span
class="key">O</span> (the letter &ldquo;O&rdquo;, not the number
&ldquo;0&rdquo;; alternatively, select <span
class="menu">Tools&nbsp;&raquo; Color Picker</span>).  Left-click as close
as possible to the top right-hand corner of the image.  A <span
class="window">Color Picker</span> dialog box will appear.  Write down the
<span class="gui">Hex</span> hexadecimal value of the colour: although it
should be <kbd>8ca8e6</kbd> (the colour chosen in <a
href="#step11">step&nbsp;11</a>), it is more likely to read something like
<kbd>8aa9e6</kbd> &mdash; at least, this was the case for the Sinorcaish
logo!  Although this colour is similar to the desired colour, it is
sufficiently different that the transition between colours will be
noticeable.</p>

<p>Select the main image window again and open the <span
class="window">Colormap</span> editor dialog box by selecting <span
class="menu">Dialogs&nbsp;&raquo; Colormap</span>.  Now increment the
colour index value from 0 to 255 until you find the one corresponding to
the value you previously wrote down.  In the case of the Sinorcaish image,
for example, colour <kbd>8aa9e6</kbd> corresponded to index 222.  Change
the <span class="gui">HTML Notation</span> edit box from the noted value
to <kbd>ff0000</kbd> (red), as shown in Figure&nbsp;12:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen12.png"
    width="260" height="330"
    alt="[Screenshot of the Colormap dialog box]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;12:</strong> Screenshot of the Colormap dialog
    box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing this allows you to see exactly which pixels correspond to the
relevant index, as shown in Figure&nbsp;13:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/logo-screen13.png"
    width="530" height="190"
    alt="[Screenshot of the modified image]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;13:</strong> Screenshot of the image with modified
    palette index.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having confirmed that the only pixels changed are on the right-hand
side of the image, change the <span class="gui">HTML Notation</span> edit
box to the correct value of <kbd>8CA8E6</kbd>.</p>

<p>Now, repeat this entire process with the white pixels used in the
centre of the white text: the pixel colour should be <kbd>ffffff</kbd>,
although it was <kbd>fefffc</kbd> in the case of the Sinorcaish logo.
Other pixel colour values are not so critical.  Finally, save the image by
pressing <span class="key">Ctrl+Shift+S</span> (or select <span
class="menu">File&nbsp;&raquo; Save as&hellip;</span>), which gives you
the opportunity of confirming the <span class="window">Save as PNG</span>
settings.</p>

<p>There are two further optional steps: adding PNG image-specific
comments, and creating an optimised version of the image.  The first
requires the <span class="program"><a
href="http://sng.sourceforge.net/">sng</a></span> program, the second the
<span class="program"><a
href="http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/">pngcrush</a></span>
program.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/">Portable Network
Graphics specification</a> defines numerous text string keywords that can
be used to annotate a PNG image.  These keywords include
&ldquo;Title&rdquo;, &ldquo;Author&rdquo;, &ldquo;Description&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; and &ldquo;Comment&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, the
GIMP does not support most of these keywords; in fact, some versions of
the GIMP do not even support the &ldquo;Comment&rdquo; field correctly.
The solution is to use <span class="program">sng</span> to convert the
image to a text file, edit that file and reconvert to a PNG image.</p>

<p>To convert your logo image to a text file, type the following on the
command line, replacing <span class="fn">filename.png</span> with your
logo image&rsquo;s filename:</p>

<pre>
<kbd>sng <var>filename.png</var></kbd>
</pre>

<p>Next, edit the resulting text file <span class="fn">filename.sng</span>
using your favourite text editor.  Search for the line starting with
&ldquo;<code>IMAGE&nbsp;{</code>&rdquo; and add something similar to the
following <em>before</em> that line:</p>

<pre>
tEXt {
    keyword: "Title";
    text: "The Sinorcaish logo";
}
tEXt {
    keyword: "Author";
    text: "John Zaitseff";
}
tEXt {
    keyword: "Copyright";
    text: "Copyright (C) 2004-06, John Zaitseff.  All rights reserved.";
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, you can add as many <code>tEXt</code> chunks as you
like, each having a different keyword and associated text.  Please note
that the text part of each <code>tEXt</code> chunk must be in ISO 8859-1
format; the <code>tEXt</code> chunks must appear before
<code>IMAGE</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have added the <code>tEXt</code> chunks to the SNG text file,
you need to rerun the <span class="program">sng</span> program.  In
addition, it is wise to make a backup copy of the original image before
doing so:</p>

<pre>
<kbd>cp -p <var>filename.png</var> <var>filename.png.copy</var></kbd>
<kbd>sng <var>filename.sng</var></kbd>
</pre>

<p>Assuming running <span class="program">sng</span> was successful, the
final step is to create a version of that image that is optimised for fast
loading and minimal storage space using the <span
class="program">pngcrush</span> program.  You can undertake this step even
if you did not use <span class="program">sng</span>.  Type the following
on the command line, replacing <span class="fn">filename.png</span> with
the filename used by your logo image:</p>

<pre>
<kbd>pngcrush -m 0 <var>filename.png</var> <var>filename.png.new</var></kbd>
<kbd>mv <var>filename.png.new</var> <var>filename.png</var></kbd>
</pre>


<h3 id="step20">Step 20: The End</h3>

<p>You have finally finished creating a logo that you can use with the
Sinorcaish stylesheet.  Congratulations!  You can now exit the GIMP by
pressing <span class="key">Ctrl+Q</span> (or by selecting <span
class="menu">File&nbsp;&raquo; Quit</span>).  Figure&nbsp;14 shows the
results of following these instructions for the Sinorcaish logo
itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://www.zap.org.au/documents/styles/sinorcaish/example/sinorcaish.png"
    width="325" height="60"
    alt="[The final Sinorcaish image]" /><br />

    <strong>Figure&nbsp;14:</strong> The final Sinorcaish image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can now incorporate your logo image into your site&rsquo;s header,
as suggested on the Sinorcaish <a href="sample.html#design-header">Sample
Page</a>; you will need to know the filename of your logo (obviously), and
its width and height.  Happy coding!</p>
