			<h3>Heading</h3>

			This is where the main content actually goes.  You can write about anything you like to stick in here, that's the great thing about <a href="http://www.oswd.org/">Open Source Web Design</a>.  You can fill this entire area up with all of your juicy content and let everyone on the planet take a look at what you've produced.
			<br/><br/>

			The more content you've got the better the design actually looks.  Most people seem to use Latin to fill up gaps, I like to write any old rubbish that comes in to my head.
			<br/><br/>

			<h3>About the Design</h3>

			This is my first design for OSWD, I was inspired to do it when I saw how many quality designs were already available.  I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom and I can be found <a href="http://www.benedictoneill.com/">on my personal website</a>.

		</div>

		<div id="subcontent">

			This is the subcontent of the page. You can put anything you like down here, maybe some interesting footnotes a random quote -- whatever you want! The background for the footer is actually a little gradient that goes to black, if I type more you'll get to see it.
			<br/><br/>

			I'm not sure I want to type much more. There's only so much pointless text one person can write before they start ranting about random things, oh look, I've started ranting.
