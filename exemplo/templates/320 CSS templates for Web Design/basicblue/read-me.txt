The template is free to use, all I ask is you let me know where it is and that the link back to
my place remains.

I originally develped this from an old dreamweaver 6.0 template and it's mainly css asthetics 
that have changed. The css therefore may need tidying up to get rid of any old unused stuff.

It should validate though - if not let me know at webmaster@blogireland.ie and I'll gladly 
fix it. The xhtml is valid though - feel free to check :) 

Template design/layout/color remains my copyright basic-blue 2006
