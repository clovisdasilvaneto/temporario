<span class="contentHeader">About Kopellian</span>
<p>This layout was inspired by my high school European History teacher. He moved to Scotland to major in theology. I hit upon the idea that I could make an XHTML template as a tribute to him as well as submit the layout to OSWD. Plus, I did not feel like studying for finals. Oh well.</p>

<span class="contentHeader">What You Need To Know About the Layout</span>
<p>The layout is <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">valid XHTML Transitional</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">valid CSS</a> (for the most part...). Comments have been added that will (hopefully) facilitate editing of this template. The page has been tested thoroughly in Firefox 1.0.7, Internet Explorer 6.0, and Opera 8.51. And, not surprisingly, IE renders the page the worst.</p>

<p>The menu at the right really does not extend the length of the page. Using a little bit of trickery, it <i>appears</i> to fully extend. This was possible because the <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> that holds the menu and the content has the background color set to the color of the menu. The block with actual content, after making the background color white and setting <span class="code">overflow: auto;</span>, (with some minor adjustments elsewhere) thus makes it seem like the two blocks are table cells, even though they are not.</p>

<span class="contentHeader">Blame the General</span>
<p>This page was <a href="http://www.oswd.org/user/profile/id/6986/" title="Generalissmo&apos;s Open Source Web Design profile">created by Generalissmo</a> (or me, whichever you prefer). Use this as much as you want - the template is for everyone's use. Please email me if you intend to edit this and resubmit it as a design on OSWD.</p>

<span class="contentHeader">Be Careful With the Image</span>
<span class="imageBox"><img width="174" height="124" src="images/khruschev_castro.jpg" alt="Khruschev and Castro. Probably in the &apos;60&apos;s" /><br /><span class="txt">Never trust a bearded man with a bald man. Never.</span></span>
<p>This is a bit tricky to deal with. Currently, the image is set to <span class="code">float:left;</span> and that makes it a bit of an issue. You need enough text so that the text pushes the <span class="code">contentHeader</span> further down, giving the image enough room to float without any visual mishaps. Also, it is necessary to change the width of the containing block to that of the image. I tried to code it so the width would wrap to the image (and not the text), but it was not working. The code has been thoroughly commented, so locating the <span class="code">width</span> attribute that needs to change will not be hard.</p>

<span class="contentHeader">Yes, Another Quote From Nietzsche</span>
<span class="quoteBlock">
As long as one lives through an experience, one must surrender to the experience and shut one's eyes instead of becoming an observer <i>immediately</i>. For that would ruin the good digestion of the experience: instead of wisdom one would acquire indigestion.<br />
