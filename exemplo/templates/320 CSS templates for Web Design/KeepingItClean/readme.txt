Hiya,

First of all I would like to say thank you 
for downloading my template and I hope it 
serves the purpose you have in mind for it.

If you would like to change the colour of 
this template there are a few graphics that 
will need changing. Within the '~Development'
directory there is a Macromedia Fireworks 
file named 'mock.png', use this file to 
change the colour of the template and export 
the ready drawn slices into the 'img' directory.

I have only provided you with the green graphics, 
however, if you would prefer the pink ones you 
can either create them yourself or send me an 
e-mail at jenna@growldesign.co.uk and I will 
forward them to you.

Good Luck!
