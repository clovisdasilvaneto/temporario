	<h2>changes.</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Page hyperlinks are a bit easier to notice</li>
		<li>Made the green menu slightly darker so that the white links are easier to see</li>
		<li>Fluid design</li>
		<li>Code redone (not that I am saying mine is better, I just like coding my own way.)</li>
		<li>Gradients resize with font</li>
		<li>More user friendly</li>
		<li>Different banner to accomodate for the fluid layout (original wasn't wide enough)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If anyone can give me links etc on how to improve accesability, I would be very happy to read them. Please use the

	<h2>design.notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>800x600 and up (Can stretch to 2000px wide without the banner running out)</li>
		<li>valid xhtml/css</li>
		<li>looks great! (not open to subjective dispute)</li>
		<li>Tested and ok in IE5.5, IE6, Firefox 1.51, Opera 8.53 (although IE5.5 has a small bug, but it still looks fine)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I have heard a few people complaining about the lack of fluid designs. With the increase
	of larger screens and higher resolutions, some people are getting sick of looking at a small thing
	in the middle of the screen</p>
	<p>A problem with fluid designs is that once the content stretches wide, the line lengths become
	rather long, and are harder to read. Hopefully because the content on this is 75% wide, the line lengths
	do not become too wide.</p>
